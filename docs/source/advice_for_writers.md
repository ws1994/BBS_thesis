* [Other ways to connect](#other-ways-to-connect)

## Getting started

Before you make a documentation change, you might like to connect with other
<<<<<<< HEAD
people working on the Fabric documentation. Your [Linux Foundation
account](./CONTRIBUTING.html#getting-a-linux-foundation-account) will give you
access to many different resources to help you connect with other contributors

## Discord

Hyperledger Fabric uses [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hyperledger) for
interactive discussions on a variety of project topics.
Reach out to us on the fabric-documentation channel to discuss documentation
topics including contributions, questions, feedback, and translation.

## Documentation workgroup call

A great place to meet people working on documentation is the monthly Documentation workgroup
call. The agenda is published in advance, and
there are minutes and recordings of each session. Find out more on the
[Documentation
wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Documentation+Working+Group).

## Join a language translation workgroup

Each of the international languages has a welcoming workgroup that you are
encouraged to join. View the [list of international
workgroups](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/I18N/International+groups).
See what your favorite workgroup is doing, and get connected with them.
Each workgroup has a list of members and their contact information.

## Other ways to connect

Hyperledger Fabric has many other collaboration mechanisms such as mailing
<<<<<<< HEAD
lists, contributor meetings and maintainer meetings. Find out about these and
